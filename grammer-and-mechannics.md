 # Grammar and Mechanics

To keep our content consistent we adhere to the following grammar rules and mechanics. This guide will define our style for how we write technical documentation. 

## Links

Write links that are descriptive and have meaning. State where the links go and what content will be found there. It is best to use keywords from the linked page. Using descriptive links allows the reader to easily scan pages and assists with screen reading technologies. 

>❌  
>You will find more documentation here.

## Click vs Select

We use the word **select** instead of **click** when addressing our readers. This action can be used agnostically across devices. 


## Italics

In general, we don’t *Italicize*, instead, we **bold** words. This allows readers to more easily scan our documentation. 

## Capitalization

We use a couple of different capitalizations. Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word and proper nouns in a phrase.


### Headers/Titles - Title Case

When writing titles and headers we follow title case guidelines. 

> ❌   Create an In-app purchase

> ✅  Create an In-App Purchase

### Other Content - Sentence Case 

We write all other content (except tiles and headers) in sentence case. 

>✅   Capitalize the name of RevenueCat terms such as the Purchases SDK or Offerings. 

>❌   We don’t capitalize words such as email, internet, etc. 

### Referencing Other Companies
Honor’s the companies own names for themselves. Go by the official website.

>✅   In the Google Play Console. 


## Code in Text

When writing code in the documentation it’s best to separate it from regular text.

### Large Code Blocks

For longer blocks of code, use a code snippet block to keep all of the code contained and formatted

< add code block>

### Small Code References 

For small code references, such as an SDK method or parameter from a webhook event, always contain it in backticks

>✅    The `getOfferings` method will fetch the Offerings from RevenueCat

>❌  The getOfferings() method will fetch the Offerings from RevenueCat


## Contractions

We like to keep our tone conversational so we use contractions regularly. 


## Dates

Spell out months and days of the week in either long or short form. 

### Short form:  Abbreviate to 3 letters, no period 

>✅    Mon, Tue, Wed - Jan, Feb, Mar

### Long-form: Spell out in body copy, or whenever the day or month is framed by other words

>✅    Saturday, August 18

## Exclamation Points

We love sharing our enthusiasm with an exclamation point! They can help keep communication light. Use them when needed. 

## Hyphens 

### Email vs E-mail

We reference email without the hyphen.


### Sign -in/up vs Sign in/up 

When used as a verb, it’s two words 

>✅   Please sign in to your account

When used as an adjective, it’s hyphenated. 

>✅  The sign-up page crashed


### Login vs  Log in vs Log-in

When used as a noun or adjective, it’s one word or hyphenated.

>✅   Enter your login (log-in) information

When used as a verb it’s two words. 

>✅  Log in with your account


## Numbers 

When referring to numbers it’s best to use digits instead of spelling the word out in most cases. It helps draw the eye of the reader to the important content. 

>✅    The Apple subscription terms require users to cancel subscriptions at least 24 hours before the next renewal.

When the number doesn’t represent an actual fact, but generalization spell out the word

>✅   We have thousands of developers using RevenueCat.


## Emojis

Emojis are a fun way to add humor and visual interest to your writing but use them infrequently and deliberately.


## Writing About RevenueCat 

Always capitalize the ‘R’ and ‘C’ in RevenueCat.

Refer to RevenueCat as ‘we’ not ‘it’.
