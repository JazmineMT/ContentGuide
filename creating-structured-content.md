# <div align='center'>  Creating Strucutred Content 


When writing technical documentation, there are cases where a table, photo, etc., is the best way to display data. This guide will go over our best practices for creating additional structured content for a page.

## Tables vs. Lists

We use tables and lists to show complex data in a more accessible, readable format.

When deciding if a table or list  is the right option, let’s reference the table below:

| Item Type  |      Example      |  How to Present |
|:------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
|Each item is a single unit |  List of steps to follow when debugging  | Numbered list, lettered list, bullet points |
| Each item is comprised of related data |    A set of parameters in setting up a RevenueCat product |   Use a table  |


## Glossary
Throughout our documentation, we often are referencing products or tools that are unique to RevenueCat.To make sure our reader always understands our references. It’s best to add the glossary term to the reader than review while reading. You can review the ReadMe glossary term guide here for how to add our documentation.

## Photos
Photos are sometimes needed to display information. We often use photos in our product installation guides to show different dashboards and other relevant information. 

When utilizing photos, make sure it only includes relevant information. If pointing to specific items on the page, make sure to mark up the image to reflect this. We use red identifiers when marking photos.

Here is an example of a photo marked up for documentation:
<div align='center'>
<img src='Screen Shot 2021-05-17 at 4.27.00 PM.png'/>
</div>

Don’t forget to create Alt text that described the photo, allowing access to screen reading technologies.

## Callouts
Some content is so crucial that we need to separate it from the rest of the document. We use flavored callouts to display this. 

### Success
The success callout is best for letting the reader know a task is complete,  a small reminder before continuing, or a helpful tip. 

> 👍  Success
> 
> You might let a reader know that they are good to move to the following document


### Info 
Info callout is for giving additional relevant information. These could contain a link out to external documents for more details. 

>📘  Info
> 
> You could use this space to pointer a reader to some external documents


### Warning 
These are best used to alert our readers to process with caution or warn of a common mistake we see. 

> 🚧  Warning
> 
> You could let the reader know about a feature to be careful about
  
### Error

>❗  Error

## Next Steps 
At the end of our documents, always include Next Steps at the bottom of documentation when relevant. Acceptable items to be included can be the following document you want the reader to visit or a blog post with similar helpful information. 

Here is an example of a Next Steps included in our documentation:
