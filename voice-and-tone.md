✅  Unfortunately, Apple’s sandbox environment is notoriously flaky - 
    there are regular outages and sometimes purchases can get hung up in their system. 
    Most of the time this error is due to sandbox downtime, 
    but you can read about all the causes for this error in our guide on error handling 
    here: https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/errors#--store_problem.  
  
    Just to clarify, there's nothing you as a developer or RevenueCat 
    can do to resolve these errors except retrying later.

## Voice vs. tone 

Our voice always stays the same, but our tone will change based on the situation. Think of it this way; if you're whispering or yelling, you have stayed the same - just changed your tone. 



Voice (doesn't change)
We always want to be:

Conversational
Action focused
Clear and Concise
Helpful
  
  
Tone (varies based on situation)
We can make sure things sound more:

Friendly 
Urgent
Encouraging




If a customer is reaching out to us facing an integration problem, they are likely stressed. They are likely looking for a fast and easy-to-understand solution - so being direct and concise is best here. However, if a customer reading through documentation or comes to us after shipping their app, we can choose to be more friendly and in those exclamation points!
